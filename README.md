Virtual Machine MacOS

I would recomend checking out the attaced files its better and had images attached

In this repo I will go over how i used UTM to create virtual machines on MacOS. Just in
case you don't know what a virtual machine is, it's a tool that allows you to basically
emulate other OS, Let's get started.

Step 1: installation of UTM
First, you will need to visit their website here it is https://mac.getutm.app/, here you
just hit download.

Alternatively, you can install it from the app store directly, fun fact it used to be
restricted so you would have had to sideload it know you don't.
When you finish installing ad open it you will see this page

Step 3: set up
From here you need to press the add button at the top left and select the architecture
which is most likely arm64 but could vary. After you must import your disc image drive
where you want to boot from
Here you can choose Virtualize or emulate depending on your preference process mostly
same
But depending on version you might see this

Here you select what you want to emulate for now, I'm just going to do Windows.
From this screen you want to just specify you setting and how much memory and Machine
you want to use and maybe even cores.

From here you select the windows and the Boost ISO images and yeah that's pretty much
it. To get aa Boot iso image you will need to go here
https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/windows-10 and follow the instructions. It is around 4GB
so if you really need you could boot it on a USB or hard drive, I recommend this.

This is how it looks

After installation makes sure you use either intel x64 or x86 for intel and apple silicon for silicon mac. Then just hit play this is
different for silicon macs for silicon mac you will need to install from the website the one
linked previously but it's pretty much the same.
Finally you just setup windows 11 make sure you use a usb or something it take alot of
storage.
